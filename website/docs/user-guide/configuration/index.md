# Configuration

PuzzleSpring offers two types of configuration: in-app settings that can be changed at runtime, and environment variables that require a restart.

## Quick Links

- [In-App Settings](in-app-settings) - Runtime settings configurable through the admin interface
- [Environment Variables](environment-variables) - Server configuration set before startup
