    <h4>Who are we?</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>We are Puzzle Hunt CMU, a group of puzzle enthusiasts from Carnegie Mellon University.</li>
      <li>We work together to solve Puzzle Hunts such as the <a href="http://www.mit.edu/~puzzle/">MIT mystery hunt</a>, or any of the many tech company puzzle hunts (examples of such companies include Microsoft, APT and Palantir).</li>
      <li>We also write and host CMU's very own puzzle hunt once a semester, with the goal of providing a fun-filled experience to as many members of the community as possible.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>What is a puzzle hunt?</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Very simply put, it's an event where people get together to solve carefully designed puzzles which somehow link together on a larger scale.</li>
      <li>A puzzle hunt is typically characterized by its structure. In addition to several normal puzzles,
       each round has a meta-puzzle, which requires teams to have solved most of the normal puzzles to even unlock,
       and often requires solvers to incorporate answers from that round's normal puzzles to make sense of.</li>
      <li>Our puzzle hunt's structure changes from semester to semester in order to provide new challenges for solvers.</li>
    </ul>
