  <h4>What are the puzzles like?</h4>
  <p>
    There are a huge variety of puzzle types, like wordplay, logic, or multimedia.
    For examples of the kinds of puzzles we'll give you, check out our 
    <a href="{% url 'puzzlehunt:archive' %}">Past Hunts</a>.
  </p>

  <h4>How do I solve a puzzle?</h4>
  <p>
    Every answer to a puzzle is an English word or phrase.
    When you think you have the correct answer, type it into the answer box on the puzzle page.
  </p>

  <p>
    But be careful about guessing too much if you're not sure of the answer.
    If you submit too many incorrect guesses for the same puzzle within a short amount of time,
    our server will rate-limit your guesses. When this happens, please wait before submitting again.
  </p>
  
  <h4>How do I register?</h4>
  <p>
    {% if hunt.no_team_mode %}
      You can register <a href="{% url 'puzzlehunt:team_create' %}">here!</a>
    {% else %}
      Register your team of {{hunt.team_size_limit|apnumber}} (or fewer if you want)
      <a href="{% url 'puzzlehunt:team_create' %}">here!</a>
    {% endif %}
  </p>

  <h4>What do I need?</h4>
  <p>
    <ul>
      {% if not hunt.no_team_mode %}
        <li>A team of no more than {{hunt.team_size_limit|apnumber}} people.</li>
      {% endif %}
      <li>
        A laptop, phone, or other device with internet access. You'll need this to register,
        view puzzles, and submit your answers.
      </li>
      <li>Paper and pencil may be useful for scratch work.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  
  <h4>How long will it last?</h4>
  <p>
    The hunt will run from
    {{ hunt.display_start_date|date:" F jS " }} {{ hunt.display_start_date|time:"h:iA" }} to 
    {{ hunt.display_end_date|date:" F jS "}} {{ hunt.display_end_date|time:"h:iA e" }}.
  </p>

  <h4>I think there is an error in this puzzle.</h4>
  <p>
    You can contact the staff at
    <a href="mailto:{% contact_email %}?subject=Puzzle%20Hunt%20Question">{% contact_email %}</a>.
    If there is in fact an error, we will make an announcement to everyone.
  </p>

  <h4>Is there anything else I should know?</h4>
  <p>
    Nothing on this and the registration page is a puzzle crucial for completing the hunt.
    No, really, this is not a puzzle.
  </p>

  <h4>Wait, I have more questions!</h4>
  <p>Email <a href="mailto:{% contact_email %}?subject=Puzzle%20Hunt%20Question">
    {% contact_email %}</a> with "Puzzle Hunt" somewhere in the subject line.</p>
